### Main
The main source code is a program to showcase the expression.

### Fibonacci
The fibonacci source code is used to calculate fibonacci numbers.
Change the following variable to another fibonacci number `FiB_TaRgEt := 300!` this variable can be found on the first line of the source code. 

### Turing
The turing source code is an attempt to build a turing machine in the Youri programming language. The code executed has 2 states. 
`state 1: Flips the binary value, 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1, moves to the next digit`
`state 2: moves to the next digit (No additional operations are performed)`
The result of this program is :
```
input -> output
0000 -> 1010
1111 -> 0101
0101 -> 1111
0001 -> 1011
```

### Test
Used to test expressions
The output of the program should be as follows
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4                   = 10
1 / 2 + 1 * 20 / 10 + 2 - 10    = -5.5
11 + (1010 / 2) * 11            = 5566.0

TeSt_2 - TeSt_2 * TeSt_2 / TeSt_2
11 - 11 * 11 / 11               = 0

TeSt = 1010
TeSt * TeSt + TeSt
1010 * 1010 + 1010              = 1021110

TeSt = 1021110
Test + 11 - 100                 = 1021021
```
